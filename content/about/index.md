I'm Tom and I'm a self-taught NodeJS/Golang/Python/PHP & Swift programmer, with 10+ years of self-taught 
Linux Systems Administration experience, I can also speak both English and Deutsch!

I started my journey at around 11 years old when I met a few friends online all the same age as me who 
had been working with Linux and creating websites for about a year prior to my journey,
after getting to know them we'd used to work with Linux through renting Virtual Servers from hosting 
companies and setting up and working on our own projects at the time.

Due to this experience I developed life long friendships and built upon a very addicting hobby working 
with Linux, my experience has led me to working with almost every distribution that existed at the time 
for example, 
Ubuntu/Debian, CentOS/Fedora/RHEL & Arch Linux, I have also had experience working with *BSD systems and 
some mild experience working with Windows Server.

After about 6 years of building on my hobby of working with Linux systems I'd built an extensive knowledge of various fundamentals about the underlying software behind many of the most popular technology stacks used in the world; I was fascinated by this.

After developing a complete understanding of managing and working with Linux systems I believed it was 
time to progress in my journey and begin to study a few high-level programming languages,
I had however had some experience in the past with working with coding, however I believed there came a 
point in which I needed to really set my mind into studying further, due to a passion to create more 
thrilling projects.

I had begun this journey by learning two languages, Swift & NodeJS; I was building mobile apps and the 
backends to go with it for fun and the sole purpose of educating myself to work with the chosen 
languages.

After spending about a year studying NodeJS & Swift I developed a deep understanding of the underlying 
fundermentals of programming and decided to progress into web development using PHP, I created a few 
long lost projects using PHP, MySQL & Redis (for caching user data)
however I decided that a journey into web development was not much my thing and that I'd much preferred 
working on the backend, to which I decided to study Python & Golang, whilst Python is much more a 
popular language and quite interesting to work with, I have found Golang has been one of my favourite 
languages to work with so far.

I am still progressing through my journey; you really don't ever stop learning, however I will try to 
list my skills & experiences below.
