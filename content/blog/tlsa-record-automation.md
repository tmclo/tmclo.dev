Just thought I'd make a quick update to share my latest project I've got on my GitHub which can automate your TLSA records with CloudFlare and Python if you're using LetsEncrypt

[**Link to project**](https://github.com/tmclo/tlsa-py)

I may update this post further in the future with more information on how to use this project to your advantage.
